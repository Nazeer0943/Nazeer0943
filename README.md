## 🚀 Projects
###  Cybersecurity Projects

- - **[Cybersecurity Capstone Project](https://github.com/Nazeer0943/Cybersecurity-capstone-scan)** – Coursera  
  Simulated a SYN-based port scan on my PC (localhost) to mimic how attackers identify open ports for exploitation. Captured network traffic using Tcpdump, then analyzed it with Wireshark to detect scan patterns. Used Windows Defender Firewall to block port 3306 and compared pre- and post-block traffic behavior. This hands-on project deepened my understanding of real-world SOC analysis and network defense techniques.

- **Safety-by-Design App Concept** – Trust and Safety Africa Academy  
  Collaborated on a conceptual mobile/web application that embeds Safety-by-Design (SbD) principles such as proactive user protection, transparent policies, and consent-aware features. The app was designed with risk mitigation, privacy, and accessibility in mind. [Project's slides](https://gamma.app/docs/Afrique-Whistle-A-Safety-by-Design-App-for-African-Youth-1mrr21k77uwesty), [Original description of the project.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oj8ScgUGKQkCsEC_jEGznINjHXfOkMylBYEd-ie5K2Q/edit?tab=t.0)

- **Online Safety Awareness Campaign** – Trust and Safety Africa Academy  
  Led a public awareness project to educate technical and non-technical audiences on staying safe online. Covered topics such as cyberbullying, misinformation and disinformation, youth, and social media. View the [presentation slides](https://gamma.app/docs/Safe-and-Smart-Online-Empowering-Teens-for-a-Safer-Digital-Future-v4g2yl1odnd15jd?mode=doc) and watch the [recorded session](https://www.loom.com/share/fd77325b6ec7488bae2e1591e837332d?sid=e91659df-3003-4877-b82e-4f8f0030f587).





###  Data Science Projects

- - **Data Science Fellowship Project** – Arewa Data Science Academy  
  Currently participating in a multi-phase fellowship covering Python, Data Science, and Machine Learning. Completed hands-on projects and assignments in the Python phase [(Stage 1)](https://github.com/Nazeer0943/Assignments_Arewa_DS), including data types, control flow, functions, and file handling. See the capstone project for Stage 1's [completion](https://github.com/Nazeer0943/My_Arewa_Data_Science_Capstone_Project). Now actively working on Data Science assignments [(Stage 2)](https://github.com/Nazeer0943/AREWA-DATA-SCIENCE-STAGE-2-ASSIGNEMENTS), applying skills in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. Machine Learning (Stage 3) will follow.
